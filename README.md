# Boosting-Algorithms
A machine learning project that raises issues related to PM2.5 particles in Jakarta. This research is entitled analysis of PM2.5 classification based on meteorological factors in Jakarta using various Boosting Algorithms: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.

The condition of air quality in the Jakarta area is getting worse as can be seen by the high concentrations of PM2.5 that have reached unhealthy levels. It is known that meteorological parameters are one of the causes of the accumulation of PM2.5 concentrations in the region. This is how the Boosting Algorithms is used to implement a classification analysis of PM2.5 concentrations based on meteorological parameters in Jakarta.

The XGBoost algorithm has excellent performance both in terms of accuracy and computation compared to other Boosting Algorithms.
